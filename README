This program receives the name of an input and output file into the argument
vector. The program opens both files and reads data from the input file into a
2D dynamic array. The program then locates the "Max Line" in the 2D array and
prints the index of that line into the output file. The max line is represented
by the line in which the value in column j is larger than or equal to the
value in the same column j of all the other rows. If no max line is found, the
program prints the value -1 into the output file.

Run time of the program is O(M*N^2) when M is numbers of cols and N is
numbers of rows.

Compile: gcc -Wall ex0a.c -o ex0a
Run: ex0a

Input: An array where the first digit in each line represents the number
	   of digits in that line.
	   Example:
	   2 5 15
	   3 12 17 0
	   1 9
	   5 11 16 -2 38 79

Output: The index of the row that meets the requirements of "Max Line".
		Example:
		1
